Initial analysis of RNA-Seq data was performed in RNA-Seq_analysis.md
this performs co-expression analyses and searches for potential promotor motifs.

# Four key stages of analysis to be performed

A) Building a coexpression network and export it
B) Counting kmers in the 3kb upstream region of all genes in the coexpressed set
C) Test these kmers for enrichment

## A) Building a coexpression network

```bash
OutDir=analysis/coexpression
mkdir -p $OutDir
ProgDir=/home/adamst/git_repos/scripts/phytophthora_fragariae/RNA_Seq_scripts
gene_table=gene_pred/annotation/P.fragariae/Bc16/Bc16_gene_table_incl_exp.tsv
$ProgDir/WGCNA_input_clean.R --gene_table $gene_table --out_dir $OutDir
```
