Initial analysis of RNA-Seq data was performed in RNA-Seq_analysis.md
this performs co-expression analyses and searches for potential promotor motifs.

# Four key stages of analysis to be performed

A) Building a coexpression network and export it
B) Counting kmers in the 3kb upstream region of all genes in the coexpressed set
C) Test these kmers for enrichment

## 1. Building a coexpression network
