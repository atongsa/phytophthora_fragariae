Initial analysis of RNA-Seq data was performed in RNA-Seq_analysis.md, this performs co-expression analyses and searches for potential promotor motifs.

#Four key stages of analysis to be performed:
1. Building a coexpression network
2. Exporting the network to find genes coexpressed with our target (Bc16|g24882.t1)
3. Counting kmers in the 3kb upstream region of all genes in the coexpressed set
4. Test these kmers for enrichment
