#DREME analysis to try to identify UNGAPPED short motifs for which a given set of sequences is significantly enriched for
#Input:
#1st argument - input FASTA sequences to be used for motif discovery
#2nd argument - FASTA sequences to be used as background control (ie. not expected to
# contain a shared motif). They can be subsampled from e.g. file containing equivalent
#genomic sequences using sub_fasta_subsample.sh script.
#Output:
#Folder (suffix "dreme") containing sequence logos, text files with sequence motifs
