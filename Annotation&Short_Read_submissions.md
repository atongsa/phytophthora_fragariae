# Commands to prepare gene annotations and raw reads for submission to NCBI

This appears to be a complex procedure, following Andy's commands.
Bioprojects & Biosamples have already been created.
This is for *P. fragariae* and *P. rubi*

## Submission steps

Fasta files were uploaded initially to allow for contamination screen
(See Genbank_corrections.md), however as the MiSeq genomes were submitted as a
batch submission, I have been advised there is no way to update them and the
whole submission has to be repeated.
