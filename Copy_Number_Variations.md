# Genes with copy number variation between BC-16, BC-1 and NOV-9 were identified

Following publication of the following paper on *P. infestans*, a similar
approach to investigating CNV between three isolates representing each of the
races in the UK123 population.
Paper: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12862-018-1201-6

Illumina reads already aligned to BC-16 assembly in:

## Calculate average read depth

### Convert gene gff to bed, required for samtools

```bash
gene_gff=gene_pred/annotation/P.fragariae/Bc16/Bc16_genes_incl_ORFeffectors.gff3
OutDir=CNV_analysis
mkdir -p $OutDir
ProgDir=/home/adamst/git_repos/tools/seq_tools/feature_annotation
python $ProgDir/gff2bed.py --gff_in $gene_gff --out_dir $OutDir
```

### Sort output bed file

```bash
gene_bed=CNV_analysis/Bc16_genes_incl_ORFeffectors.bed
sorted_bed=CNV_analysis/Bc16_genes_incl_ORFeffectors_sorted.bed
sort -k1,1V -k2,2n -k3,3n $gene_bed > $sorted_bed
```
