An assembly has been published by a Chinese group and is available on Genbank, but the assembly looks of low quality and he paper is poorly written so confirming that it definitely is _Phytophthora fragariae_. BLAST analysis has shown Î²-tubulin to have the _P. fragariae_ type SNP, and ITS was not found by BLAST.
