The main resources you will be asking for are CPU(slots) and memory.

The memory can be requested with h_vmem, this is the maximum amount of memory a slot can take, if it exceeds this amount your job will be automatically killed. Another memory related option is mem_free

Now, we can also ask for more CPU using -pe option. This option stands for "parallel environment" and each cluster sets up a set of parallel environments for parallel processing. The syntax for the option is as follows:-pe [environment name] [number of slots].
